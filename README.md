# Student-Mental-Health-Prediction
A data mining project using R to predict mental health risks among university students using Naïve Bayes and Decision Trees.
# Mental Health Risk Prediction among University Students

## Project Overview
This project leverages data mining techniques to predict mental health risks among university students based on survey data collected from IIUM. [cite_start]It compares the effectiveness of different classification models to identify students "At Risk" for early intervention.

## Key Features
- **Dataset:** Primary data collected from 50 participants via a structured survey.
- **Predictors:** Academic workload, stress levels, sleep patterns, social engagement, and physical health.
- **Techniques Used:** - Naïve Bayes (Best Performer)
  - Decision Trees
  - k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) 

## Results
Based on our evaluation, the **Naïve Bayes model** achieved the highest accuracy of **80%**, making it the most suitable for this predictive task.
- **Naïve Bayes:** 80% Accuracy 
- **Decision Tree:** 60% Accuracy 
- **k-NN:** 40% Accuracy 

## Tools Used
- **Language:** R 
- **Environment:** R Studio 
- **Libraries:** `dplyr`, `rpart`, `e1071`, `class` 

## Conclusion
The study highlights that high stress levels, poor sleep quality, and limited social engagement are critical indicators of mental health risks.
