# Student-Mental-Health-Prediction
A data mining project using R to predict mental health risks among university students using Naïve Bayes and Decision Trees.
# Mental Health Risk Prediction among University Students

## 📌 Project Overview
This project leverages data mining techniques to predict mental health risks among university students based on survey data collected from IIUM. It compares the effectiveness of different classification models to identify students "At Risk" for early intervention.

## ⭐ Key Features
- **Dataset:** Primary data collected from 50 participants via a structured survey.
- **Predictors:** Academic workload, stress levels, sleep patterns, social engagement, and physical health.
- **Techniques Used:** 
  - Naïve Bayes (Best Performer)
  - Decision Trees
  - k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) 

## 📊 Results
Based on our evaluation, the **Naïve Bayes model** achieved the highest accuracy of **80%**, making it the most suitable for this predictive task.
- **Naïve Bayes:** 80% Accuracy 
- **Decision Tree:** 60% Accuracy 
- **k-NN:** 40% Accuracy 

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Language:** R 
- **Environment:** R Studio 
- **Libraries:** `dplyr`, `rpart`, `e1071`, `class` 

## Conclusion
The study highlights that high stress levels, poor sleep quality, and limited social engagement are critical indicators of mental health risks.
